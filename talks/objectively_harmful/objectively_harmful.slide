###
* Directive 1

#--
* On Manifestation

"Program to an 'interface', not an 'implementation'." - Gang of Four (Design Patterns)

#--
* What Is An Interface?

An interface is a behavior set.

.code ./code/a_interface.go /BGN1/,/END1/

: methods available on an object

#--
* What Is An Implementation?

An implementation is expressed behavior.

.code ./code/b_implementation.go /BGN1/,/END1/

#--
* Directive 1 Restated

Program to required behavior, not particular concretions.

.code ./code/c_howto_notto.go /BGN1/,/END1/

: depending on concretions:
: - sets a hard limit on argument type
: - exposes unnecessary data/behavior
: - invites spaghetti code

#--
* Benefits Of Depending On Interfaces *

- Separation of Concerns
- Encapsulation
- Polymorphism

.caption *These things are not always needed or most convenient.


###
* Directive 2

#--
* On Architecture

"Favor 'object composition' over 'class inheritance'." - Gang of Four (Design Patterns)

#--
* What Is An Object?

Broadly; An object is an instance of a data structure (state) with behavior.*

.code ./code/d_object.go /BGN1/,/END1/

.caption *See [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(computer_science)][this link]] for more details.

: some argue that primitives are not objects because they do not have methods,
: but many primitives have behavior like +, -, ++, ! etc.
: consider: is an instance of struct without methods an object?
: sometimes objects are defined even more simply as any instances of data that can be interacted with
: and, some would argue objects can only exist by using classes,
: however, that only influences whether a language is object-based AND ALSO object-oriented

#--
* What Is Composition?

Composition is the sharing of behavior using structural organization.

.image ./img/svg/composition.svg 500 _

#--
* What Is A Class?

Not strictly or exhaustively...

- structure declaration (fields)
- assignment of some or all fields
- declaration and assignment of behavior (methods)
- pre-assigned "magic methods" (most are reassignable)
- declaration of taxonomic relationships
- declaration of implemented behavior sets

: a small spoiler: Go structs only declare structure

#--
* What Is Inheritance?

Inheritance is the sharing of behavior using taxonomic relationships.

.image ./img/svg/inheritance.svg 500 _

: if Go lacks classes, and therefore lacks taxonomic relationships, 
: and therefore lacks inheritance, is Go object-oriented?
: -
: *please note that the gradient of color implies that inherited structure and behavior are not necessarily clearly conveyed.

#--
* Directive 2 Restated

When sharing behavior, favor organization over relationships.

#--
* Benefits Of Using Composition

To understand this, it will help if we understand the pain points inherent to the alternative(s). Let's take at closer look at the OO-options...

.image https://storage.euggo.org/present/img/closer_look.gif 240 _

: next, we'll take a look at the two most common forms of inheritance: class-based and prototype-based
: we'll also take a look at how Go structures the sharing of behavior.

###
* Class-based Behavior Sharing

#--
* Class-based Classes

.code ./code/php/a_classes.php /BGN1/,/END1/

: first, two classes are created with constructors
: each class performs the same behavior "greeting"
: greeting takes a name and returns a string with a formatted greeting
: the main logic constructs a "human" and a "wolf", then has them meet "Dan"

#--
* Class-based Classes Output

.code ./code/php/a_classes.php.out

: the output is as expected

#--
* Class-based w/Interface

.code ./code/php/b_interface.php /BGN1/,/END1/

: here an interface is added along with a function that leverages the interface
: each class must explicitly implement the interface
: the main logic is modified to use the newly added function

#--
* Class-based w/Interface Output

.code ./code/php/b_interface.php.out

: the output, again, is as expected (without change)

#--
* Class-based Inheritance (multiple)

.code ./code/php/c_inherit_impossible.php /BGN1/,/END1/

: if a new class wishes to extend multiple classes, it is simply not allowed in many languages
: this is generally because multiple inheritance creates a lot of grief, and is typically resolved through some linearization algorithm or by the order in which types are declared
: after adding the construction of a new werewolf to the main logic, the code can be tested

#--
* Class-based Inheritance (multiple) Output

.code ./code/php/c_inherit_impossible.php.out

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Many languages allow multiple inheritance with varying degrees of rationality.

.image ./img/svg/multi_inheritance.svg

: the program fails
: it's easy to see that sharing behavior this way can get ugly fast
: *the black area is meant to emphasize higher likelihood of issues

#--
* Class-based Inheritance (inline)

.code ./code/php/d_inherit_inline.php /BGN1/,/END1/

: returning to a valid approach...
: the taxonomic relationships are set inline with wolf extending human, and werewolf extending wolf
: if the constructors of inherited classes are not called, prepare for fireworks
: the greeting method of werewolf is able to access it's direct parent, but not "granparent"
: to reach the grandparent, the class name is used
: finally, the main logic is updated with a new werewolf

#--
* Class-based Inheritance (inline) Output

.code ./code/php/d_inherit_inline.php.out

: success

#--
* Class-based Inheritance (inline: drawback)

.code ./code/php/e_inherit_inline_drawback.php /BGN1/,/END1/

.code ./code/php/e_inherit_inline_drawback.php /BGN2/,/END2/

: here another interface is added along with a function that leverages the interface
: because inheritance is currently inline, only the top-level class must explicitly implement the interface
: the main logic is modified to use the newly added function

#--
* Class-based Inheritance (inline: drawback) Output

.code ./code/php/e_inherit_inline_drawback.php.out

.caption silent behavioral error

: while the code ran without programmatic error, there is a behavioral/semantic error
: a wolf should not be able to say "nice to meet you"

#--
* Class-based Composition

.code ./code/php/f_composition.php /BGN1/,/END1/

.code ./code/php/f_composition.php /BGN2/,/END2/

: here, the extends keyword is dropped and inheritance is abandoned
: each class declares it's own interface implementations
: werewolf will use fields to hold full instances of human and wolf
: any needed behavior is accessed with clarity
: the main logic is updated with the wolf being removed from the talk function (otherwise it will error programmatically)

#--
* Class-based Composition Output

.code ./code/php/f_composition.php.out

: the output is now as expected



###
* Prototype-based Behavior Sharing

#--
* Prototype-based Example

.code ./code/js/a_prototypes.js

: first, two object constructors are created
: each object is capable of the same behavior "greeting" (no difference from the class-based examples)
: the main logic constructs a "human" and a "wolf", then has them meet "Dan"

#--
* Prototype-based Example Output

.code ./code/js/a_prototypes.js.out

: the output is as expected

#--
* Prototype-based w/Interface (sort of)

.code ./code/js/b_interface_sorta.js /BGN1/,/END1/

: while there are no interfaces in JS, 
: a function that requires an object with a single method is added
: the main logic is modified to use the newly added function

#--
* Prototype-based w/Interface (sort of) Output

.code ./code/js/b_interface_sorta.js.out

: the output, again, is as expected (without change)

#--
* Prototype-based Inheritance (multiple)

.code ./code/js/c_inherit_impossible.js /BGN1/,/END1/

: prototype-based languages work on the object-based concept that objects can have defined "prototype" which is used for any behavior not provided in the child object
: while this is still highly limited (and can be quite fragile), it is far more structural than classes
: regardless, multiple inheritance is not permitted and setPrototypeOf silently fails as seen by the werewolf's freq field not being set
: this also means that defining the intended version of werewolf's greeting would result in a programmatic failure
: after adding the construction of a new werewolf to the main logic, the code can be tested

#--
* Prototype-based Inheritance (multiple) Output

.code ./code/js/c_inherit_impossible.js.out

.caption silent behavioral failure (and likely eventual programmatic failure)

#--
* Prototype-based Inheritance (inline)

.code ./code/js/d_inherit_inline.js /BGN1/,/END1/

: so, inlining again...
: the taxonomic relationships are set inline with human acting as wolf's prototype, and wolf acting as werewolf's prototype
: all ancestors are available with prototypal inheritance, but keeping to the type system is cumbersome
: finally, the main logic is updated with a new werewolf

#--
* Prototype-based Inheritance (inline) Output

.code ./code/js/d_inherit_inline.js.out

: success

#--
* Prototype-based Inheritance (inline: ok)

.code ./code/js/e_inherit_ok.js /BGN1/,/END1/

.code ./code/js/e_inherit_ok.js /BGN2/,/END2/

: now, to verify how inheritance behaves in JS, another function that requires an object with a single method is added
: this inheritance is inline, so only the top-level object must have the new method added
: the main logic is modified to use the newly added function
: because prototypal inheritance is more strucural than class inheritance, the basic instance of wolf does not incorrectly inherit any behavior from human, but werewolf does get it "passed-through" it's prototype wolf.

#--
* Prototype-based Inheritance (inline: ok) Output

.code ./code/js/e_inherit_ok.js.out

: the output is as expected

#--
* Prototype-based Composition

.code ./code/js/f_composition.js /BGN1/,/END1/

.code ./code/js/f_composition.js /BGN2/,/END2/

: approaching this now with composition, fields are set with instances of human and wolf
: "assign" is used to "apply" behavior and structure to werewolf
: despite being a little magical, accessing behavior is now more free and clear

#--
* Prototype-based Composition Output

.code ./code/js/f_composition.js.out

: success



###
* Object-based Behavior Sharing

#--
* Object-based Example

.code ./code/go/a_structs.go /BGN1/,/END1/

: two structs are created (no construction functions at this point)
: each struct provides the same behavior "greeting"
: the main logic constructs a "human" and a "wolf", then has them meet "Dan"

#--
* Object-based Example Output

.code ./code/go/a_structs.go.out

: the output is as expected

#--
* Object-based w/Interface

.code ./code/go/b_interface.go /BGN1/,/END1/

: here an interface is added along with a function that leverages the interface
: interfaces are implicity satisfied in Go, so nothing more is needed
: the main logic is modified to use the newly added function

#--
* Object-based w/Interface Output

.code ./code/go/b_interface.go.out

: the output, again, is as expected (without change)

#--
* Object-based Composition (incomplete)

.code ./code/go/c_composition_incomplete.go /BGN1/,/END1/

: skipping the non-existent inheritance...
: a new struct is created which embeds a human and a wolf
: behavior sharing is immediately structural due to embedded methods and fields being "promoted" to top-level
: a construction function is added that handles the construction of the human and wolf dependencies
: after adding the construction of a new werewolf to the main logic, the code can be tested

#--
* Object-based Composition (incomplete) Output

.code ./code/go/c_composition_incomplete.go.out

: at compile time it is clear that ambiguity must be resolved

#--
* Object-based Composition (working)

.code ./code/go/d_composition.go /BGN1/,/END1/

: because Go does not declare any taxonomic relationships, ambiguities are forced to the forefront
: "spooky action at a distance" is avoided for methods
: be careful with fields and their related scopes
: the ambiguity is resolved by defining a method directly on the embedding type

#--
* Object-based Composition (working) Output

.code ./code/go/d_composition.go.out

: looking good

#--
* Object-based Composition (success)

.code ./code/go/e_composition_good.go /BGN1/,/END1/

.code ./code/go/e_composition_good.go /BGN2/,/END2/

.code ./code/go/e_composition_good.go /BGN3/,/END3/

: here another interface is added along with a function that leverages the interface
: only the human type needs to implement the interface
: the main logic is modified to use the newly added function

#--
* Object-based Composition (success) Output

.code ./code/go/e_composition_good.go.out

: success confirmed
: if "bob" the wolf had been sent to talk, it would have been a programmatic compile time error



###
* So What?

#--
* Composition And Interfaces Are Fundamentally Useful

Inheritance (often):

.image https://storage.euggo.org/present/img/wrong_turn_somewhere.jpg 360 _

.caption It's even worse without strong typing!

: Since 1994 our community has been formally admonished to understand this.
: Encumbrances on either composition or inheritance should be considered a severe cost for the development of complex systems.

#--
* If Go Lacks Inheritance Is It Still Object-Oriented?

Absolutely. It epitomizes good OO practice.

.image https://storage.euggo.org/present/img/yes_snoop.gif 300 _

: Go not only favors composition over inheritance, it foregoes inheritance entirely. Inheritance through taxonimic relationships is hostile to the stable construction of complex systems.
: It could be argued that Go is only object-based and not object-oriented due to it's lack of inheritance, but the inclusion of embedding (and the resulting field/method promotion) emulates inheritance in a structured and useful manner such that it thoroughly models the behavior sharing effectiveness of object-oriented languages while ensuring that best practices are followed.

#--
* When Might The Two Most Prominent OO Directives Not Apply?

Consider not using interfaces when dealing with:

- optimizations
- scripts
- not fully understood complexity/abstractions

Consider not using composition when dealing with:

- languages that make composition more difficult than workarounds (e.g. traits)

: interfaces have a cost, so optimization can be achieved by avoiding them
: the verbosity and intellectual cost of interfaces may not be useful enough to define for small programs
: designing an interface without first understanding the abstraction has it's own costs (slowed refactoring, delayed growth, etc)
: sometimes languages offer built-in workarounds that are sufficient (and maybe even quite convenient). Use them.

#--
* Are There Any Pertinent Technical Quotes?

"Orthogonality is a system design property which guarantees that modifying the technical effect produced by a component of a system neither creates nor propagates side effects to other components of the system. Typically this is achieved through the separation of concerns and encapsulation, and it is essential for feasible and compact designs of complex systems."

#--
* Are There Any Pertinent Philosophical Quotes?

"It is important that we know where we come from, because if you do not know where you come from, then you don't know where you are, and if you don't know where you are, you don't know where you're going. And if you don't know where you're going, you're probably going wrong." - Terry Pratchett

#--
* Can We See The Multiple Inheritance Graphic Again?

Sure:

.image ./img/svg/multi_inheritance.svg

#--
* Is There A Graphic For "Multiple Composition"?

Yep:

.image ./img/svg/multi_composition.svg

: while composition shines for methods, if fields are treated as one would treat methods, there will be difficulty.
: however, this is simply resolved by making all field access explicit. personally, I try to never access "promoted" fields.
: when composing a type's available methods, we are usually concerned with how some interface is being satisfied. fields are not a concern on that "side" of an interface

#--
* Are Object.assign And Object.setPrototypeOf Available In ES5?

.code ./code/f_es5_polyfill.js

: sort of, and not setPrototypeOf in IE. here are the polyfills

#--
* What If An Unwanted Method Is Promoted?

.code ./code/g_hide_promoted.go /BGN1/,/END1/

.code ./code/g_hide_promoted.go.out

* Are We Finished Here?
